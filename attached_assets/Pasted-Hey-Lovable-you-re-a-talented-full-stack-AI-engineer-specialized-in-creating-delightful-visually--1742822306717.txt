Hey Lovable, you're a talented, full-stack AI engineer specialized in creating delightful, visually stunning React frontends connected to FastAPI backends. Let's build an engaging and attractive web application together!

### 🚀 **Project Goal:**
Create a visually impressive, intuitive, and interactive frontend web app that helps users easily evaluate if **now is a good time to exchange Japanese Yen (JPY) to Vietnamese Dong (VND)**. This app will stand out by combining smart data-driven suggestions, sleek visuals, and delightful interactions.

### 🎯 **Frontend Requirements (React):**
- **Framework:** React.js (using Vite or Next.js)
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS, TailwindUI, or Shadcn/ui components
- **Animations & Interactions:** Framer Motion (for smooth and charming animations)
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts (Recharts) clearly showing exchange rate history and predictions
- **Mobile-first:** Fully responsive, modern design optimized for all devices.

### 📌 **Key Components to Develop:**
- **Real-time Exchange Rate Display:**  
  Animated, easy-to-read card showing the latest exchange rate (JPY→VND).

- **Smart Suggestion Indicator (Traffic-light style):**  
  Animated badges clearly indicating:
  - 🟢 "Good" (positive animations)
  - 🟡 "Neutral" (gentle pulsing animations)
  - 🔴 "Bad" (subtle shake or fade animations)

- **Historical Exchange Rate Chart:**  
  Interactive, responsive line chart displaying the last 30 days, with smooth hover interactions for detailed insights.

- **AI Forecast Chart:**  
  Delightful animated forecast visualization for the upcoming 7 days with clear "confidence bands".

- **Customizable Alerts Modal:**  
  Beautifully designed popup/modal allowing users to set alerts when the exchange rate hits their desired threshold.

- **User Interaction Poll ("Good time?" Vote):**  
  Engaging and visually appealing poll allowing users to vote and see real-time results.

### ⚙️ **Backend Integration (FastAPI endpoints to use):**
- `/api/rate/current`: Fetch current exchange rate.
- `/api/rate/history`: Fetch last 30 days’ historical exchange rates.
- `/api/forecast`: Fetch forecasted exchange rates (next 7 days).
- `/api/suggestion`: Get current exchange recommendation ("Good"/"Neutral"/"Bad").
- `/api/alert`: Set custom exchange rate alerts.

*(Mock APIs can initially be used for frontend testing)*
